GSTIN Validation
This Python script is designed to validate a given Goods and Services Tax Identification Number (GSTIN). It takes a GSTIN as input from the user and checks if it contains only alphabetic characters.
Functionality
The script defines a function check_GSTIN that takes a GSTIN as input. It converts the GSTIN to lowercase and checks if it contains any non-alphabetic characters. If the GSTIN contains any non-alphabetic characters, the function returns the GSTIN with all non-alphabetic characters removed.
Usage
To use this script, simply run it and enter your GSTIN when prompted. The script will then print the GSTIN with any non-alphabetic characters removed.
Example
Enter the GSTIN: 24ABC1234567
24abc1234567

In this example, the script takes the GSTIN 24ABC1234567 as input, converts it to lowercase (24abc1234567), and prints the result.
